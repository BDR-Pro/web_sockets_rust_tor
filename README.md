# 🌐 Tor Blockchain Router 🛡️

Welcome to the Tor Blockchain Router, a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of Rust, Tokio, and Tor to provide a secure and anonymous way to interact with blockchain networks. This project is perfect for developers and blockchain enthusiasts who are looking for ways to enhance privacy and security in blockchain operations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧅 Tor Integration: Uses Tor's network to anonymize your connections, making it harder to trace blockchain transactions back to you.
- 🌍 WebSocket Communication: Efficient real-time data transfer between clients and servers using WebSocket protocols.
- 📦 Blockchain Operations: Support for downloading, verifying, and synchronizing blockchain data.
- 🛠️ Asynchronous Runtime: Built on Tokio, this project efficiently handles I/O-bound tasks asynchronously, improving performance and scalability.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Privacy-Focused: Designed with privacy at its core, utilizing SOCKS5 proxies to route traffic through Tor.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you dive into the Tor Blockchain Router, ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)
- Tor installed and configured on your system

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bdr-pro/web_sockets_rust_tor.git
    cd web_sockets_rust_tor
    
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```sh
    cargo build --release

    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```sh
    cargo run --release

    ```

## 📐 Configuration

To customize the Tor Blockchain Router for your needs, edit the `config.toml` file in the root directory. You can specify the Tor proxy address, listening ports, and other important settings.

## 🖥️ Usage

After starting the Tor Blockchain Router, follow the on-screen instructions to choose which port to listen on for incoming WebSocket connections. The router will automatically handle connections, blockchain data synchronization, and maintain privacy through the Tor network.
